Variables
The basic unit of a program is called a variable,which is assigned a value.If a variable name begins with a number, it cannot be used, but a variable name can include upper and lower case letters, as well as underscores. Variable names traditionally begin with lowercase letters in Python. Learned that there are serveral types of variables in Python, including integers, which are whole numbers; floats, which are decimal numbers; complex numbers, which are used for complex mathematical calculations; and strings, which are collections of characters. Booleans, which are true or false values, are another type of variable in Python.
